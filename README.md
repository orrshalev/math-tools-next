# Math Toolbox
This is the source code for a website I built to further math education by creating fun and interactive tools. A production version hosted on AWS Lightsail can be found [here](https://mathtoolbox.org).

## Stack
The T3 stack is used as the basis of this project. More specifically: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
